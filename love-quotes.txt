As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once
Loved you yesterday, love you still, always have, always will
I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more
I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out
Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive
I need you like a heart needs a beat
When I say I love you more, I don’t mean I love you more than you love me. I mean I love you more than the bad days ahead of us, I love you more than any fight we will ever have. I love you more than the distance between us, I love you more than any obstacle that could try and come between us. I love you the most
If I know what love is, it is because of you
I swear I couldn’t love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow
If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you
